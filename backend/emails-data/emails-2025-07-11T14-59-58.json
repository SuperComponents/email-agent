      "body_text": "Hi Treslingo Support Team,\n\nI hope you’re doing well! I’m writing to express my frustration about losing my daily streak. I was on a 65-day streak and feeling super proud of myself, but I woke up today to find that it’s dropped to zero! I have no idea how this happened. I live in a different timezone (UTC-5), and I usually practice late at night, so I’m wondering if the change in the clock last weekend had anything to do with it.\n\nI really love using Treslingo to learn Spanish, and I’ve been making great progress with the speaking and grammar exercises. But losing my streak has been really disheartening. Is there any way you could help me recover it? I’ve attached a screenshot of my profile showing my previous streak and progress.\n\nThank you so much for your help!\n\nBest regards,\n\nMaria Gonzalez\nmaria.gonzalez@email.com",

      "body_text": "Dear Treslingo Team,\n\nI hope you can assist me with a billing question I have regarding my premium subscription. I signed up for it a couple of months ago, and since then, I’ve been charged $9.99 each month. However, I wasn’t sure if my subscription was automatically renewed. I thought I’d seen an option to cancel it before the next billing cycle, but now I can’t find that information in the app!\n\nI have found it super helpful having no ads and being able to download lessons for offline use while commuting to work. But, to be honest, I’m still on the fence about whether I want to continue the premium service because my free time is limited, and I don’t want to be charged if I'm not using it enough. I would appreciate it if you could let me know how to manage my billing options – maybe I can pause or cancel it instead?\n\nThank you for your help. Looking forward to your prompt response!\n\nSincerely,\n\nJohn Thomas\njohn.thomas@email.com",
