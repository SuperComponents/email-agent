I’ve worn them for a few days hoping they’d stretch, but it doesn’t seem to be working. Can you suggest how I might be able to get a better fit? Do you offer any exchange options?\n\nThanks,\nMike Johnson\n\nmike.johnson@example.com	<html><body>Hi there,<br><br>I recently purchased a pair of TacticalPro Series gloves (Order GA-12345) thinking a large would fit just fine, but they’re actually a bit snug on my hands.
