# ⚠️ LEGACY AGENT IMPLEMENTATION

**This agent implementation is NOT actively developed or integrated into the main application.**

## Status: LEGACY / NOT ACTIVE

- **Current Active Agent**: `../agent3/`
- **Integration Status**: Not integrated with current backend
- **Development Status**: Not actively maintained
- **Usage**: Do not use for new development

## What This Directory Contains

This directory contains the original "proresponse-agent" implementation that was used in early versions of the project. It includes:

- TypeScript-based agent with basic email processing
- Skeleton RAG system implementations
- OpenAI integration patterns
- Thread naming utilities
- Enhanced agent responses

## Why It's Still Here

This directory is kept for:
- **Historical reference** - Understanding the evolution of the agent system
- **Code archaeology** - Useful patterns and implementations that might be referenced
- **Branch compatibility** - Other branches might still reference this implementation
- **Backup purposes** - Contains working code that could be useful for troubleshooting

## Current Active Implementation

**Use `../agent3/` instead** - This is the actively developed and integrated agent system.

See the main [INTEGRATION.md](../INTEGRATION.md) for current integration instructions.

## Migration Notes

If you're working with code that references this legacy agent:

1. **Update imports**: Change from `proresponse-agent` to `agent3`
2. **Update function signatures**: The API has changed significantly
3. **Update database integration**: Agent3 uses direct database integration
4. **Update environment variables**: Different configuration structure

## Do Not Delete

**Please do not delete this directory** without verifying that:
- No other branches depend on it
- No external references exist
- All useful patterns have been migrated to agent3/
- Historical documentation needs are met

---

**For current development, use `../agent3/` - see [INTEGRATION.md](../INTEGRATION.md)**
