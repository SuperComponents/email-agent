//1. Everytime I type in the thread search bar, a large loading indicator appears, hiding all of the content. This is janky and bad UX
//2. The number of threads does not match up with the counts displayed. Can we derive these from the actual mock data. 
//3. Currently, when I refresh, it resets the state. Can we please store the current selected thread in the URL so that on refresh it returns to the same state?
