# Technical Support Guidelines

## Purpose
To establish a clear set of guidelines for providing technical support to customers using the Treslingo app.

## Scope
This document is intended for all technical support team members.

## Support Workflow
1. **Ticket Creation**  
   - Upon receiving a technical issue, create a support ticket in the ticketing system.
   - Include detailed information about the problem, including user account details and any error messages.

2. **Initial Analysis**  
   - Identify the nature of the technical issue (e.g., app crashes, audio problems).
   - Check known issues database for any ongoing problems related to the reported issue.

3. **Troubleshooting Steps**  
   - Follow the relevant troubleshooting guide for the specific issue:
     - **App Crashes**: Check for updates, clear app cache, reinstall the app.
     - **Audio Issues**: Verify device settings, check app permissions, test with headphones.
     - **Sync Problems**: Ensure the user is logged into the same account across devices, check internet connection.

4. **Resolution**  
   - If resolved, document the solution in the ticket and inform the customer.
   - If not resolved, escalate to Tier 2 support as per the escalation procedures.

5. **Feedback and Follow-Up**  
   - After resolution, follow up with the customer to ensure satisfaction.
   - Ask for feedback on the support experience to improve processes.

## Best Practices
- Maintain a calm and friendly demeanor during interactions.
- Use clear, non-technical language when communicating with customers.
- Regularly update knowledge base articles based on resolved issues to assist other team members.
