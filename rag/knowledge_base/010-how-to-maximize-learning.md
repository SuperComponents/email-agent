## How to Maximize Your Learning with Streaks, XP, Gems, and Leaderboards

### Streaks
Streaks are a great way to motivate you to practice daily. Here’s how to manage your streaks:

1. **Understanding Streaks**: A streak is the number of consecutive days you complete lessons. Maintaining a streak can help reinforce your learning habits.
2. **Daily Streaks**: To keep your streak intact, you must complete at least one lesson each day.
3. **Streak Freezes**: If you miss a day, you can use a streak freeze. Premium users get 3 freezes per month, while free users get 1. To use a freeze:
   - Go to your profile.
   - Select 'Streaks'.
   - Click on 'Use Streak Freeze' if you have one available.

### XP Points System
Experience Points (XP) are earned through completing lessons and activities. Here’s how you can maximize your XP:

1. **Earn XP**: Completing lessons will earn you XP. The more challenging the lesson, the more XP you receive.
2. **Daily Goals**: Set daily goals for XP to track your progress.
3. **XP Leaderboards**: Compete with friends to see who has the most XP. Check the leaderboard in the social section of the app.

### Gems Currency
Gems are the in-app currency that you can use for various features:

1. **Earning Gems**: You earn gems from completing lessons, achievements, and daily challenges.
2. **Using Gems**: You can use gems to unlock special features or buy additional streak freezes.
3. **Saving Gems**: Consider saving your gems for premium features that enhance your learning experience.

### Leaderboards
Leaderboards help you stay competitive and motivated:

1. **Accessing Leaderboards**: Tap on the 'Social' section in the app.
2. **Viewing Leaderboards**: You’ll see your rank compared to friends and other users.
