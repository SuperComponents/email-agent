**Context & Goal:**
We have a fully functional intercom-style chat widget for customer embedding, but it needs a complete visual overhaul to match our polished landing page aesthetics. The widget should become a showcase piece that users actively want to share and interact with.

**Current State:**
- Functional chat widget with all core features working
- Design quality significantly below our landing page standards
- Located here: /home/duff/email-agent/chat-widget/cloudflare-widget/src/app.tsx

**Design Objectives:**
Transform this widget into a visually stunning interface that:
- Creates an immediate "wow factor" when opened
- Feels premium, modern, and cutting-edge
- Encourages social sharing due to visual appeal
- Maintains 100% current functionality

**Design Direction:**
- **Visual Impact**: Apply contemporary design trends (glassmorphism, micro-animations, dynamic gradients, sophisticated typography)
- **Interactivity**: Add smooth transitions, hover effects, and responsive animations that make the interface feel alive
- **Polish**: Implement professional spacing, shadows, and visual hierarchy
- **Accessibility**: Ensure proper contrast ratios and semantic markup

**Success Criteria:**
The redesigned widget should be so visually impressive that users:
- Feel excited to open and use it
- Want to take screenshots to share on social media
- Recommend it to others based on design alone
- Consider it a reflection of premium product quality

**Technical Requirements:**
- Preserve all existing functionality
- Ensure responsive design across devices
- Optimize for performance despite visual enhancements
- Use modern CSS features and thoughtful JavaScript interactions
- Ensure the colors used align with the application (landing-page, frontend)

**Deliverable:**
A complete redesign of the chat widget that pushes the boundaries of what's possible in web interface design while maintaining the robust functionality users depend on.
