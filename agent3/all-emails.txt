Hello GauntletAIron Team,

I hope this message finds you well. I recently received my order (GA-12345) for the DragonScale Gauntlets, and I was really excited to use them. However, upon opening the package, I noticed that the gloves have a significant tear in the left gauntlet's leather, which was quite disappointing. They looked amazing in the photos, but now I'm worried about their durability.

I understand that damages can happen during shipping, but I would appreciate your guidance on how to proceed. Can I return these for a replacement, or is there a repair service available? I’ve attached a photo of the damage for your reference.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,

Hi Emily,

Thanks for getting back to me so quickly! 

I’m really looking forward to trying out the TacticalPro gloves. I’ve been checking the sizing chart, and I’m slightly between a Medium and a Large. I usually wear a size 9 in regular gloves but I want to make sure I get the best fit since I’ll be using them for some intense training.

Should I go with the Large for a little extra room, or do you think Medium would be the better choice?  

Thanks again for your help!

Best,
Mike Johnson

P.S. I can’t wait to see how these perform in action!

Hi Mike,

Thank you for reaching out! We’re excited to hear that you ordered our TacticalPro Series gloves. To ensure you get the perfect fit, we recommend measuring your hand circumference around the knuckles, excluding the thumb. Depending on the measurement, you can refer to our sizing chart on the website to find your ideal size.

If you’re between sizes or have any specific concerns about fit, feel free to reply back, and I can help you choose the best option!

Thanks again for choosing GauntletAIron. Looking forward to hearing from you!

Hi there,

I recently placed an order for the TacticalPro Series gloves (Order GA-12345) and I’m a bit concerned about the sizing. I usually wear a medium in regular gloves, but I’ve heard that tactical gear can fit differently. 

Could you please provide guidance on whether I should stick with medium or consider going up to large?

Also, is there a return policy if they don’t fit as expected? I just want to make sure I don’t get stuck with something that doesn't fit right.

Thanks for your help!

Hi Team,

I hope you’re doing well! I recently purchased the TacticalPro Series gloves (Order GA-12345) about 2 weeks ago, and I have a concern. When I tried them on, they felt a bit tight around the knuckles, and I’m worried it might affect my movement during use.

I ordered a size large based on the size chart on your website, but now I'm thinking I might need an extra large. Is there a way I can exchange them for a larger size? Also, if you could let me know how the return process works, that would be great!

Thanks for your help!

Hello,

I hope this message finds you well. I recently ordered a pair of RoadGuard Series gloves (Order GA-12456) and they arrived yesterday. I was super excited to try them out, but I think I might have messed up the sizing!

I ordered a size medium because my hands are usually in that range, but these feel a bit tight, especially around the knuckles. I can still wear them, but I’d love to know if it’s possible to exchange them for a larger size. 

Also, could you let me know the process for returning them? I want to make sure I do it right so I can get the new ones as soon as possible.

Thanks a ton for your help!

Hi GauntletAIron Team,

I hope you're doing well. I'm writing to inform you about an issue I encountered with my recent purchase. I ordered the DragonScale Gauntlets (Order Number: GA-12345) about two weeks ago, and they arrived yesterday. Unfortunately, upon opening the package, I noticed some damage to the gauntlets. 

Specifically, there are scratches on the metal plating, and the leather appears to be scuffed. I’ve attached some photos for your review. I was really looking forward to using these for my cosplay event next month, so I’m quite disappointed to see this.

Could you please let me know how we can resolve this? I would appreciate either a replacement or a refund. Thank you for your assistance!

Best regards,

Sarah Thompson

Hi there,

I hope you’re doing well! I recently ordered a pair of TacticalPro Series gloves (Order Number: GA-12345) and I’m a bit unsure about the sizing. 

I normally wear a size large, but I’ve heard that your sizing runs a little smaller than usual. Can you please let me know if I should consider going up a size?

Thanks for your assistance! I’m really looking forward to receiving my gloves as I’ve heard amazing things about them.

Best,
Mike Johnson

P.S. If I do need to exchange them for a larger size, how should I go about that? Appreciate your help!

Hi GauntletAIron Team,

I hope this message finds you well. I recently ordered the TacticalPro Series gloves (Order GA-12345), and I encountered a bit of a problem with the sizing. I used your sizing chart, but they feel a bit too tight across the fingers and I’m worried that it might affect my performance during use.

Can you please advise if there's a way to exchange them for a larger size? I really need these gloves for a training session next week. Any assistance you could provide would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks so much for your help.

Hi there,

I hope you’re doing well! I recently placed an order for the TacticalPro Series gloves (Order #GA-12345) and I’m a bit concerned about the sizing. I wear a medium in most gloves, but I’ve heard that these can fit differently due to the padding and design.

Could you please provide me with a sizing chart or some guidance on how these fit? I don’t want to end up with something that’s either too tight or too loose.

Thanks for your help!

Best,
Mark Jensen

P.S. I can’t wait to try them out once I get the right size!

Hi GauntletAIron Team,

I hope this message finds you well. I recently ordered a pair of your DragonScale Gauntlets (Order GA-12345) on October 15th, and they arrived yesterday. While I absolutely love the design and how they feel, I noticed a small issue with the stitching on the left glove. It looks like it might come undone if I’m not careful.

I’ve attached a picture for your reference. I was really hoping to use them at a medieval reenactment event next weekend, so I would greatly appreciate any advice on how to proceed. Can they be repaired, or is there a possibility of exchanging them for a new pair?

Thanks for your help!

Hi there,

I hope this message finds you well. I recently ordered a pair of TacticalPro Series gloves (Order Number: GA-12345) but I'm a bit unsure about the sizing. 

I went with a large based on the size chart, but I just wanted to double-check since I've heard your gloves can fit a bit differently than standard sizes. My hand measures about 9 inches around the knuckles, and I'm concerned they may be too tight or too loose during use.

Could you please advise if I should consider a medium instead? I'm really excited to start using them for training, but I want to make sure I get the right fit!

Thanks for your assistance!

The left glove seems to be fitting a bit tight around the wrist area, despite following the sizing guide provided on your website. I wanted to reach out to see if there’s any way to adjust this or if I might be eligible for an exchange. 

I really love the design and quality of the gloves, and I was looking forward to using them for my upcoming motorcycle trip next month. Any assistance you could provide would be greatly appreciated!

Hi Jessica,

Thank you for your understanding and for guiding me through the process. I’m grateful for the detailed sizing info you provided. 

I’ll go ahead and return the gloves for an exchange in size Large. I hope that will fit better because I’ve heard great things about the TacticalPro Series and would love to fully experience them! 

Could you let me know the best way to return the gloves? And is there a timeframe I should keep in mind for the exchange? 

Thanks again for your help!

Hi Jessica,

Thanks for your help! I really appreciate it. The TacticalPro Series gloves I received feel a bit tight around my wrists, and I was wondering if I could get a size exchange. I originally ordered a size large, but it seems like I might need an extra large instead.

Could you let me know the steps to exchange them? Also, do I need to send back the original pair first?

Thanks again!

Hi GauntletAIron Team,

I hope this email finds you well. I recently received my order GA-12345, which included a pair of TacticalPro Series gloves. First of all, I want to say that the quality is amazing and I'm really excited to start using them! However, I've noticed that the gloves feel a bit tight around my fingers.

I went with a size large based on the sizing chart, but now I'm wondering if I should have gone with an extra large instead. Is there a way to exchange them for a different size? I would appreciate your guidance on how to proceed with this.

Thanks in advance for your help! I look forward to your response.

Best,

Hello GauntletAIron Support,

I hope this message finds you well. I recently received my order (GA-12345) on October 15th, and I was really excited to try out my new TacticalPro Series gloves. However, when I opened the package, I noticed that the left glove was missing. I’ve double-checked the box, and there’s definitely only one glove in there.

Could you please let me know how we can resolve this issue? I was really looking forward to using these gloves for my training sessions this weekend.

Thank you for your help!

Hello GauntletAIron Team,

I hope this message finds you well. I recently received my order (GA-19834) which included the DragonScale Gauntlets and a pair of RoadGuard gloves. However, upon unboxing, I noticed that the RoadGuard gloves were missing!

I was really looking forward to trying them out this weekend for a ride. If you could help me track down the missing gloves or get a replacement sent out, I'd really appreciate it. 

I placed the order on September 10, 2023, and was expecting it to arrive in full. It’s quite disappointing to have this happen, especially with such high-quality gear.

Thank you for your help!

Hi Sarah,

Thanks for your quick response! I really appreciate the sizing guide you provided. I had a chance to measure my hands, and it looks like I should be going with a size large. 

Just to confirm, I’m a bit hesitant about the fit. Are these gloves designed to have a snug fit, or is there some give in them? I want to make sure they won’t be too tight during use.

Thanks again for your help!

Best,
Mike 

P.S. I'm looking forward to trying them out!

Hi Sarah,

Thanks for getting back to me! I really appreciate the sizing guide you provided. I had a quick question though – my measurements are right on the cusp between a medium and large. Would you recommend going with the larger size for a bit more freedom of movement, or should I stick with medium for a snug fit?

Also, I’m really looking forward to trying these out! I’ve heard great things about the durability and comfort of the TacticalPro series.

Thanks again for your help!

Best,
Mike

P.S. My order number is GA-12345, just in case you need it for reference.

Hi Mike,

Thank you for reaching out! I’m glad you’re interested in our TacticalPro Series gloves. To help you find the perfect size, could you please provide me with your hand measurements? You can measure the circumference around the widest part of your hand and the length from the tip of your longest finger to the base of your palm.

We recommend checking our sizing chart available on our website as well, it can be really helpful!

Let me know your measurements and I’d be happy to assist you further.

Hi there,

I hope you're doing well. I recently ordered a pair of TacticalPro Series gloves (Order Number: GA-12345) but I'm uncertain about the sizing. I usually wear a size large in regular gloves, but I've heard that tactical gloves can fit differently. Should I stick with a large, or should I go up a size?

Also, I noticed that the expected delivery date is tomorrow, but I haven’t received any shipping updates yet. Can you confirm if my order is on track to arrive?

Thanks for your help!

P.S. Love what you guys are doing with the gear! Can't wait to try them out in the field.

Hello GauntletAIron Team,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to express my concern regarding my recent order (GA-12345) of the DragonScale Gauntlets that I placed on March 5th, 2023. I was really excited to receive them, but unfortunately, there seems to be an issue with the fitting.

When I tried them on, I noticed that the left glove is noticeably tighter than the right one, making it very uncomfortable to wear. I followed the sizing guide provided on your website, so I’m not sure if there was a manufacturing error or what might have gone wrong.

Could you please advise on how we can resolve this? I would love to get a properly fitting pair, as I’ve heard great things about your products and was really looking forward to using them for my outdoor adventures.

Hello GauntletAIron Team,

However, I noticed that the tracking hasn’t updated in several days, and it still shows ‘label created’ without any movement. I was hoping to have them in time for a training session I have scheduled this coming weekend, so I’m a bit anxious. 

Could you please check on the shipping status for me? I’d really appreciate it if you could provide any updates or estimated delivery dates. Thank you for your attention to this matter!

Could you please assist me with this issue? I’d appreciate any help you can provide in getting the missing glove sent out as soon as possible.

Hello GauntletAIron Team,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to express my concerns regarding my recent order GA-12345, which I received on October 15, 2023.

Unfortunately, upon opening the package, I noticed that the DragonScale Gauntlets I ordered were damaged. The left gauntlet has a noticeable tear near the wrist strap, and it appears the leather was not treated properly. I was really looking forward to using them for my upcoming events, and this is quite disappointing.

Could you please advise on how to proceed with returning the damaged item? Also, I would like to know if I can receive a replacement or if it's possible to get a refund instead.

Thank you for your assistance, and I look forward to your prompt response.

Best regards,

Alex Johnson

Hi there,

I hope you’re doing well! I recently ordered a pair of TacticalPro gloves (Order No: GA-12345) and I’m a bit unsure about the sizing. I normally wear a size large in regular gloves, but I’ve heard that tactical gloves can fit differently. Could you please let me know if I should stick to large or go for a medium? 

Also, I’m a police officer and I’m really looking forward to using your gloves on the job. Any tips on sizing would be super helpful!

Thanks a lot!

Best,

Hi there,

I hope this message finds you well. I recently purchased a pair of TacticalPro Series gloves (Order GA-12345) on October 15th, and I've run into a bit of a problem. The right glove seems to fit perfectly, but the left one feels way too tight, almost unwearable.

I've tried adjusting the straps thinking it might help, but it hasn’t made a difference. I really love the quality and design of the gloves, and I’d hate to have to return them just because of this issue.

Is there a way to get a replacement for the left glove, or maybe a larger size? I appreciate any help you can provide.

Thank you for your time!

Hello,

I hope you're doing well. I recently received my order (GA-12345) of the TacticalPro Series gloves I ordered on September 15, 2023, and I'm having a bit of trouble. 

The gloves fit great, but I've noticed that the right glove has a tear near the knuckle area after just a few uses. I’m not sure if it’s a defect or if I might have snagged it on something, but I'm pretty disappointed as I expected them to be super durable given the military grade.

Could you please let me know what the next steps are for getting this resolved? I’d really appreciate your help.

Thanks a lot!

Hi there,

I hope you’re doing well! I recently ordered the TacticalPro Series gloves (Order GA-12345) on October 1st, but I’ve encountered a problem. They arrived yesterday, but the right glove seems to be a size too small. I ordered a size large, as per your sizing chart, but it’s really tight and uncomfortable. 

I would love to exchange it for an extra-large if that’s possible. Could you let me know the process for that? Also, do you need me to send the smaller glove back, and if so, how do I go about that?

Thanks for your help!

Hi there,

I hope this email finds you well. I recently placed an order for the TacticalPro Series gloves (Order Number: GA-20456) on March 15th, and I’m a bit concerned about the size I selected. I usually wear a large in most gloves, but I’ve read differing opinions on the fitment of your products.

Could you please provide some guidance on whether I should stick with a large or consider going up to an XL? I really want to make sure they fit well, especially since they’re tactical gear.

Thanks for your help!

Best regards,

Mike Johnson

Hi there,

I hope you're doing well! I recently placed an order for the TacticalPro Series gloves (Order GA-12345) about a week ago, and I wanted to check on the status of the shipment. I got an email notification saying it was shipped, but I haven’t received any updates since then, and I’m a bit worried since I need them for an upcoming training exercise.

Could you please provide me with the tracking information? That would really help ease my mind. Also, if there’s any way to expedite the shipping, I’d be happy to cover any additional costs.

Thanks a lot for your help!

Hi there,

I recently purchased a pair of TacticalPro Series gloves (Order Number: GA-12345) a few days ago, and I'm having some trouble with the sizing. I measured my hands according to the size chart on your website, but they still feel a bit tight when I try to put them on.

Could you please assist me with this? I really love the design and functionality of the gloves and want to make sure I get the right fit. Maybe I need to size up? 

Thanks for your help!

Best,
Mark Thompson

P.S. I ordered them on October 5th and they arrived on the 8th, so thank you for the speedy delivery!

Hello GauntletAIron Team,

I hope this email finds you well. I recently purchased a pair of TacticalPro Series gloves (Order GA-12345) on October 10th, but I seem to have a bit of an issue with sizing. I ordered a size large based on the size chart provided, but they feel rather snug, especially around my fingers.

I really want to use these gloves for an upcoming training exercise, but I’m worried they might not be comfortable enough. Is there any way to exchange them for an extra large? If so, could you guide me on how to proceed with the exchange?

Thank you for your help!

Hello GauntletAIron Support,

I hope this message finds you well. I recently received my order number GA-12345 for the DragonScale Gauntlets, and I must say, I was super excited to finally get my hands on them. However, upon opening the package, I noticed that the gauntlets were damaged. There’s a noticeable scratch on the left hand glove and some of the metal plating seems to be loose. 

I really love the design and quality of your products, but this has left me a bit disappointed. Can you please advise on how to proceed? Is there a way to get a replacement pair or perhaps a refund? 

Thanks for your help! Looking forward to your response.

Hi GauntletAIron Team,

I hope you’re having a great day! I recently placed an order for the TacticalPro Series gloves (Order No: GA-12345) on September 20th, and I was wondering about the sizing. I’m usually a medium, but I’ve heard that your gloves tend to run a bit small. Can you please confirm if I should order a large instead?

Also, could you let me know when I might expect the shipment? I’m really excited to try them out for my upcoming training.

Thank you for your help!
