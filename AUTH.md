**NOTE**: 
- OAUTH with GHub and Goog haven't been implemented yet.  
- Can flip to any auth solution; this was a quick add and can easily be reverted

**TODO:** 
- Logout button needs to delete cookies
- DB needs to use the auth schema for users

## Setup

Add env variables to the frontend:

# Neon Auth environment variables for React (Vite)
VITE_STACK_PROJECT_ID=YOUR_NEON_AUTH_PROJECT_ID
VITE_STACK_PUBLISHABLE_CLIENT_KEY=YOUR_NEON_AUTH_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
