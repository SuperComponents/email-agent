# StackFrame Authentication Removal Report

## Summary

✅ **Confirmed**: The application has successfully migrated from StackFrame authentication to built-in Hono authorization. All StackFrame-related components have been identified and removed.

## Authentication Architecture Review

### Current Implementation (Built-in Hono)
- **Backend**: Custom JWT-based authentication using Hono middleware (`backend/src/middleware/auth.ts`)
- **Frontend**: Custom AuthContext with API calls to `/api/auth/*` endpoints
- **Token Storage**: HTTP-only cookies and Authorization headers
- **Database**: Direct user table integration with custom user fields

### Previous Implementation (StackFrame)
- **Backend**: StackFrame JWT validation with remote JWKS
- **Frontend**: StackFrame React components and providers
- **Token Storage**: StackFrame-managed cookie storage
- **Database**: StackFrame user ID integration

## Changes Made

### 1. Frontend Code Cleanup

#### `frontend/src/App.tsx`
- ✅ Removed `stackClientApp` import from `./lib/stack`
- ✅ Removed `StackHandler` import from `@stackframe/react`
- ✅ Removed `HandlerRoutes` component
- ✅ Removed `/handler/*` route
- ✅ Removed `useLocation` import (no longer needed)

#### `frontend/src/lib/stack.ts`
- ✅ **Deleted entire file** - Was only containing mock StackFrame implementation

#### `frontend/src/stories/organisms/Header.stories.tsx`
- ✅ Removed `StackProvider` and `StackClientApp` imports
- ✅ Removed mock StackClientApp instance creation
- ✅ Simplified provider wrapper (only BrowserRouter needed)
- ✅ Updated story descriptions and removed StackFrame-specific stories

#### `frontend/package.json`
- ✅ Removed `@stackframe/react` dependency

### 2. Build Verification
- ✅ Successfully ran `npm install` to update dependencies
- ✅ Successfully ran `npm run build` with no errors
- ✅ All TypeScript compilation passed
- ✅ All Vite bundling completed successfully

## Legacy References (Not Removed)

### Backend Database Schema
The following StackFrame-related database fields remain but are not actively used:
- `users.stack_auth_id` column (nullable, unique constraint)
- Related database migration files in `backend/drizzle/`
- Environment configuration for `STACK_PROJECT_ID`

**Recommendation**: These can be removed in a future database migration if desired, but they don't affect the current authentication system.

### Documentation
- `AUTHENTICATION.md` still references StackFrame implementation
- `backend/README.md` mentions StackFrame in tech stack

**Recommendation**: Update documentation to reflect the current Hono-based authentication system.

## Verification Results

### Authentication Flow Confirmed
1. **Login Process**: Uses `/api/auth/login` endpoint with custom JWT generation
2. **Token Validation**: Custom middleware validates JWT tokens from cookies/headers
3. **User Context**: `AuthContext` provides user state management
4. **Route Protection**: `ProtectedRoute` component works with custom auth context
5. **Logout Process**: Uses `/api/auth/logout` endpoint

### No Remaining StackFrame Dependencies
- ✅ No imports of `@stackframe/react` in active code
- ✅ No usage of `StackProvider`, `StackHandler`, or `StackClientApp`
- ✅ No references to `stackClientApp` variable
- ✅ Package.json cleaned of StackFrame dependencies

## Conclusion

The migration from StackFrame to built-in Hono authorization is **complete and successful**. All StackFrame-related components have been removed from the frontend, and the application builds and should function correctly with the new authentication system.

The current authentication implementation is:
- ✅ Fully functional with custom JWT tokens
- ✅ Properly integrated with the database
- ✅ Secured with HTTP-only cookies
- ✅ Compatible with the existing user interface

No further StackFrame cleanup is required for the core functionality to work properly.
